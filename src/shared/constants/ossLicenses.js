                    PREAMBLE:
                    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development
                    of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic
                    and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which
                    fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

                    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed
                    freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any
                    derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any
                    software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works.
                    The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of
                    license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
                    to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

                    sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the
                    following conditions:

                    1. Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or

                    and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright
                    notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files,
                    human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within
                    text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

                    3. No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless

                    not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to

                    their explicit written permission.

                    5. The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed
                    entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license.

                    TERMINATION
                    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.
